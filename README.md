Arrays: JavaScript arrays are a built-in data structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single variable. You can use various array methods, such as push, pop, shift, unshift, splice, and slice to manipulate arrays.

Stacks and queues: Stacks and queues are two common abstract data types that can be implemented using arrays or linked lists. A stack follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, while a queue follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. You can implement stacks and queues in JavaScript using arrays, or you can create a Stack or Queue class that uses a linked list as the underlying data structure.

A Set is a collection of unique values. It can store any type of values like primitive values or object references. Duplicate values are not allowed in a Set. The basic operations of a Set are adding an element, deleting an element, checking if an element exists, and getting the size of the Set.

A Set is a collection of unique values, whereas a Map is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key must be unique.

The keys in a Map can be any value, including objects, whereas the values in a Set can only be primitive data types (like numbers, strings, or booleans).

Map has some additional methods for working with keys and values, like get, set, has, and delete.

Linked lists: You can create a linked list in JavaScript using objects and pointers. Each object contains a value and a reference to the next object in the list. To implement a linked list, you can create a Node class and a LinkedList class, which contains methods to insert, delete, and traverse the list.

Binary trees: Binary trees are a data structure in which each node has at most two children. You can implement a binary tree in JavaScript using objects and recursion. Each object represents a node, and it contains a value, a left child, and a right child. You can create methods to insert, delete, and traverse the tree.

Sorting algorithms: JavaScript has built-in methods to sort arrays, such as sort() and reverse(), but you can also implement sorting algorithms from scratch. Some popular sorting algorithms include bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quicksort.

Searching algorithms: JavaScript also has built-in methods to search arrays, such as indexOf() and includes(), but you can also implement searching algorithms from scratch. Some popular searching algorithms include linear search, binary search, and depth-first search.
